# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

During the project, I made sure to regularly test the website, especially making sure that the data displayed on the web app matches the data in the website. I also checked each page has a way to escape back to the home or previous page, I made sure that all links worked as expected, and I made sure that all the things that the user required was included in the design process.


### Usability

As this website may be used by older people, I made sure to make the web app as easy to use as possible. For example, I made sure - for the front-end of the web app especially - to add as little buttons as possible, which means that the user can clearly and easily tell what each button does, and is not overwhelmed by multiple choices, and can navigate through the web app with ease. I also made sure to apply Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, such as Heuristic 1: Visibility of System Status, as after every action taken that updates the database or when they log in to the admin, I made sure to add a little "flash" message, so the user can clearly tell what has happened as a result of their actions.

### Aesthetics

In my project, I made sure to work with my end-user to create a colour-scheme that is not too bright and painful to look at, but is also interesting and vibrant. I also made sure that the colours looked pleasing to look at and did not clash with each other. I also chose a design type that is modern and minimalistic to make sure that the users aren't overwhelmed by unnecessary information.


### Privacy 

I made sure that the records that the admin sees can only be accessed through logging in to an admin account. This means that the peoples data and information can only be accessed by the admin, so that they can organize the workshops, but unauthorized people cannot go and look at the data. 


### Legal

According to NZ laws, if you are collecting personal information, you must tell the users what is being collected and why. I have implemented these laws in my "register" page. I have done the first law, you must tell the users what is being collected, as in the form, it tells you what you need to enter, which is telling them what the web app is collecting. I have implemented the second law, you must tell the users why their data is being collected, by having a little statement down the bottom of the page which describes why the data is being used.

### End-User

Throughout the project development, I checked in with the main end-user to check if the web app was meeting their standard. On the final chat, when the completed project was shown to them, the user said:
>"This looks amazing, it has definitely met my expectations"
I also made sure that the front-end of the website was simple enough to use, but not so simple that it affects the functionality of the website, meaning the needs of the less technologically skilled end-users are met, and those who are more technologically skilled can still use the website efficiently, so the needs of my end-users are met.

## Overall Review

This project was a successful project. Many things went well. One thing that went particularly well was the implementation of an orange colour scheme, as it moved the project forwards a lot in terms of UI and polish, and took little time to implement. Another thing that went well was the sql queries for the back-end of the website, as that is a major part of the web app and database querying. One thing that didn't go so well was that I found last-minute a better way to make the queries for the back-end, which meant I had to scramble to implement the changes while still showing that I had advanced database querying skills. The testing/trialing impacted the final system in many ways. In sprint one, the trialing with my user changed the design from a flat, boxy design, into a vibrant, modern design, with smooth visuals. In sprint 2, the testing allowed me to find errors in my code, and made the code work perfectly. In sprint 3, the trialing and testing allowed me to bring the uninteresting MVP into a fully functional, aesthetic and vibrant web app that works as intended. If I could do this again, I would try to manage my time better. For example, I would spend less time working on the figma design, as I took too long to decide upon a finished product design, so I could have more time to finish the coding process with ease and a little less time pressure. 
All in all, the project was a success, and my end-user is keen to start using the web app in the future as soon as the opportune time arrives.
