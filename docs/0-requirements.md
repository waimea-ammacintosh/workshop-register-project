# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

A lady at my local church wants to organize workshops for people to attend. 
But there is no easy way to keep track of who is coming and it is tricky to keep track of all the different workshops on paper.


## End-User Requirements

One end-user will be the lady that is organizing the workshops. 
She will want the back end/admin side of the website to be easily accessible, but secure, and not too hard to use.

The other main end-user will be the people signing up for the workshops. 
There are many old people that may sign up for these, so I will need to make sure that the website is user-friendly and simple to use.


## Proposed Solution

this is a project that will help a lady at my church to organize events/workshops 
and keep track of people who sign up. People can also sign up to workshops in this website.

- It will have a secure back-end/admin that the lady can access and add or remove workshops and view numbers of people who are attending
- It will have a list of all the workshops that people can click on to register
- It will have a page where people can see all the workshops that they have signed up for
- People will be able to click on the workshops to see more information about them, like who is running it, when it is, ect.
- it will have a similar theme to the main church website

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

The functionality of a website relates to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose, i.e. it works as expected.

### Relevance to the System

 It is important that my website is fully functional, so that people can sign up for the workshops and new ones can be added. If this doesn't work, people wouldn't be able to take part in the workshops and will stop using the website. 

### Impact / Considerations

 I will make sure that my website is fully functional by regularly testing all aspects of the website periodically throughout development with all sorts of data, including invalid inputs.  



## Usability

The usability implications of a website relates to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

 there are many older people who will be using this website, so if it is not very usable and simple, they may feel overwhelmed and not be able to use the site.

### Impact / Considerations

I will make sure that I make the website simple to use and it should not have too many pages to go deep into, where they may find it difficult to get back. I will also make sure that I apply Nielsen's 10 usability Heuristics.
