# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

A lady at my local church wants to organize workshops for people to attend. 
But there is no easy way to keep track of who is coming and it is tricky to keep track of all the different workshops on paper.


## End-User Requirements

One end-user will be the lady that is organizing the workshops. 
She will want the back end/admin side of the website to be easily accessible, but secure, and not too hard to use.

The other main end-user will be the people signing up for the workshops. 
There are many old people that may sign up for these, so I will need to make sure that the website is user-friendly and simple to use.
