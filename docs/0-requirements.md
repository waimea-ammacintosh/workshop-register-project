# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

A lady at my local church wants to organize workshops for people to attend. 
But there is no easy way to keep track of who is coming and it is tricky to keep track of all the different workshops on paper.


## End-User Requirements

One end-user will be the lady that is organizing the workshops. 
She will want the back end/admin side of the website to be easily accessible, but secure, and not too hard to use.

The other main end-user will be the people signing up for the workshops. 
There are many old people that may sign up for these, so I will need to make sure that the website is user-friendly and simple to use.


## Proposed Solution

this is a project that will help a lady at my church to organize events/workshops 
and keep track of people who sign up. People can also sign up to workshops in this website.

- It will have a secure back-end/admin that the lady can access and add or remove workshops and view numbers of people who are attending
- It will have a list of all the workshops that people can click on to register
- It will have a page where people can see all the workshops that they have signed up for
- People will be able to click on the workshops to see more information about them, like who is running it, when it is, ect.
- it will have a similar theme to the main church website

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

The functionality of a website relates to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose, i.e. it works as expected.

### Relevance to the System

 It is important that my website is fully functional, so that people can sign up for the workshops and new ones can be added. If this doesn't work, people wouldn't be able to take part in the workshops and will stop using the website. 

### Impact / Considerations

 I will make sure that my website is fully functional by regularly testing all aspects of the website periodically throughout development with all sorts of data, including invalid inputs. This will help me to make sure that the web app will be fully functional all the time, and the users will be happy with the system.  



## Usability

The usability implications of a website relates to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

 there are many older people who will be using this website. This means if it is not very usable and simple, they may feel overwhelmed and not be able to use the site.

### Impact / Considerations

I will make sure that I make the website simple to use and it should not have too many pages to go deep into, where they may find it difficult to get back. I will also try to make all the interactions in the website easy to use, by asking some people who are not as good with tech to use my website to see if it is simple enough to use. I will also make sure that I apply Nielsen's 10 usability Heuristics.



## Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a website relates to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant to my system as it needs to look good, or else the users may find it difficult to use. This would lead to them potentially not using my web app.

### Impact / Considerations

I will make sure that I choose a colour scheme that looks nice, and is not too bright or clashing, and I will make sure that I will adhere to common design principals in respects to layout and UI design.



## Privacy 

The privacy implications of a website relate to protecting the privacy of end-users and their data.

### Relevance to the System

I am going to be collecting emails and names from people, so I must make the website secure, so I don't leak their personal information. This could lead to people being unhappy with me and they would stop using my web app. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will make sure that you can only access the admin page with a secure password, so that the emails and names will be secure. This means that only people who know the password will be able to see the people's information, and it will be a secure site.


## Legal

The legal implications of a website involves ensuring it conforms to all relevant NZ laws.

### Relevance to the System

my web app will be collecting personal data such as names, emails, and phone numbers from people, so I must make sure that the way I am doing so is lawful and adheres to the relevant New Zealand laws of the Privacy Act 2020.

### Impact / Considerations

 I will make sure that my web app follows all the principals of the Privacy Act 2020. This includes things such as making sure I only collect relevant data, and making sure I inform the users in some way about what data is being collected, and why. I will need to add a statement somewhere in the website to make sure users can see why their data is being collected, and show the user what is being collected in the form.


## End-User

The end-user implications of a website are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

### Relevance to the System

my project will need to meet the requirements of my end users because they are the ones who will be using my web app. If I neglect the requirements of my end users, they will probably find my web app hard to use, and stop using it altogether. 

### Impact / Considerations

Throughout the project, I will regularly check in with my end-user with project updates and ask them how they think things should be, and take into consideration their ideas and needs for the project. This means that I will have a solid project that takes into consideration the requirements of the end user. For example, I might need to make the design of the front-end of the web app simple and easy to use, due to older people generally being less technologically adept, and might find a more complex design overwhelming.
