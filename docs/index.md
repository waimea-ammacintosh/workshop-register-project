## Project Description

this is a project that will help a lady at my church to organize events/workshops 
and keep track of people who sign up. People can also sign up to workshops in this website.

- It will have a secure back-end/admin that the lady can access and add or remove workshops and view numbers of people who are attending
- It will have a list of all the workshops that people can click on to register
- It will have a page where people can see all the workshops that they have signed up for
- People will be able to click on the workshops to see more information about them, like who is running it, when it is, ect.
- it will have a similar theme to the main church website
