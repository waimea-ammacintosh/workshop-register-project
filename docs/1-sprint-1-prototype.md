# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing

I talked with my user about what they thought of my flow, and they came up with some new improvements. 
one thing they said was

 > “The register button should take you to a separate page with a form on it, the form shouldn’t be on the same page” 

They also said

 > “The 'see more' button should be on teh left of the text as it might be better as you read left to right” 

 

### Changes / Improvements

From this feedback, I improved the flow diagram to include these suggestions

 - I added the form onto a separate page

 - I updated the see more button to be on the left of the text.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="350" height="450" src=https://www.figma.com/proto/BLT2CqOHnbI7Y3M45DoA0g/register-design-v1?t=ZPWO7OttAuVBCLD4-1 allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

When I showed this to my user, they thought that the design needed some improvements.
Some things that they suggested were:

> “The title/image should be centered and the admin should be smaller.”

> “The home buttons should be on the top right” 

> “Register buttons should be centered” 

> “The home should be an icon instead of a word” 

### Changes / Improvements

I took this feedback that they gave me, and centered the title/header bar, and made the admin button smaller, I moved all the "Home" buttons, and moved them all to the top right corner of the screen and replaced the old rectangular button with a house Icon instead of the word "home". I also made all the register buttons in the center of the page, not just the one on the actual form page.

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.
